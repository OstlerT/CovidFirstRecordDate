# CovidFirstRecordDate
A brief description of UK and US regional first recorded positive COVID19 testing dates. This aims to inform ferttility clinics about likely dates that patients who have had egg/sperm collection may have been infected at the time of collection, which may help inform treatment options for such patients. It also includes the dates 2 and four weeks before the first date of recorded Covid cases, to account for the fact that patients can be infectious during the incubation period when they are asymptomatic, as well as for the likelihood that the first recorded COVID-19 case may not be the true patient zero in that region.

DISCLAIMER: This information is in no way designed to give absolute dates for which patients have no chance of having Covid-19. This is a very quick, blunt estimation, which depends highly on the first patient with covid-19 in a region being tested and reported. In reality, patients from before this date may have been infected but were asymptomatic or not tested, so ultimately whilst this may help provide a generic guideline it is at the healthcare professionals discretion as to whether patients should be considered to have been at risk of infection at the time.
