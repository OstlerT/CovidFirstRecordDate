# CovidFirstRecordDate
A brief description of UK and US regional first recorded positive COVID19 testing dates. This aims to inform ferttility clinics about likely dates that patients who have had egg/sperm collection may have been infected at the time of collection, which may help inform treatment options for such patients. It also includes the dates 2 and four weeks before the first date of recorded Covid cases, to account for the fact that patients can be infectious during the incubation period when they are asymptomatic, as well as for the likelihood that the first recorded COVID-19 case may not be the true patient zero in that region.

DISCLAIMER: This information is in no way designed to give absolute dates for which patients have no chance of having Covid-19. This is a very quick, blunt estimation, which depends highly on the first patient with covid-19 in a region being tested and reported. In reality, patients from before this date may have been infected but were asymptomatic or not tested, so ultimately whilst this may help provide a generic guideline it is at the healthcare professionals discretion as to whether patients should be considered to have been at risk of infection at the time.


US sources are documented within the CSV file. Where available these have been taken from state health boards as these are reliable sources, although in many cases regional news has presented the best available source. I cannot verify the claims made in these sources, so this is left to the discretion of the user.

The UK data has been processed from another fantastic GitHub repository at https://github.com/tomwhite/covid-19-uk-data/tree/master/data, which takes daily UK government published data. For sources, please see this original repository and its owner, Tom white.

UK data only begins from the start of March, but the first case in the UK was before this date. Wikipedia has a far broader regional database for which first cases in the UK are recorded, with some news sources, although obviously these are harder to verify than government statistics.

In the UK CSV, regions with an asterisk have had cases before the beginning of march, and therefore the date given is simply the first date available. In these areas, further discretion should be advised.
